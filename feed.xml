During that time, I participated in many requests for proposal, many sales pitches and I competed against a lot of competitors. You might think that the best software always wins, but that is not the case. Many times, I heard things like <strong><em>“we choose you because you made the most competent impression”</em></strong> or <strong><em>“you worked hardest during the POC”</em></strong>.</p>

<p>This shows that it is at least 50% people business. Your impression as a software provider is as important as your software. I learned this very early in my career. I was hired by a company in Cologne, Germany to evaluate several e-commerce providers for a new website - among them Oracle and SAP. After the evaluation it was clear to me that Oracle has the far better software based on J2EE, while SAP was pitching it proprietary ITS technology. At the end they still went with SAP. Why? Because the sales pitch was superior to the one from Oracle (they showed up totally unprepared) and the CIO told me <strong><em>“The way they showed up here and pitched the solutions, the same way they will do the implementation. I have no good feeling with Oracle”</em></strong>.</p>

<p>I think that I make a good impression most of the time and I see that as a competitive advantage. COVID hurt in that regard, as there were no face-to-face meetings. Let’s hope we are soon back to onsite sales demos.</p>

<p>On the one side, there are fary tails like <strong>Little Red Riding Hood</strong>, where a wolf eats humans or Hensel &amp; Gretel, where a witch plans to eat children. I guess these stories are now also internationally very popular, but let me introduce you to a book that my mother and grandmother used to read to me when I was three years old:</p>

<h2 id="struwwelpeter">Struwwelpeter</h2>

<p>(Peter with the messy hair)
<img src="/assets/struwwelpeter/struwwelpeter.jpg" alt="Struwwelpeter" /></p>

<p>It contains stories that should teach children to listen to their parents. Funny stuff if you are not a small child.</p>

<p>There is the story about the boy that always sucks on his thumbs, even his mother tells him to stop. He still does it while his mother is not home, but if you do that kids, his guy will come and cut off both your thumbs:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/struwwelpeter/daumenlutscher.jpg" alt="Daumenlutscher" /></p>

<p>Or this nice story about Kasper, who did not want to eat his soup. After 5 days, he starved to death. I wish I could loose weight so fast.</p>

<p>Finally, this poor girl was playing with a lighter and guess what - she burned to death.</p>
