<p>This looks unnecessary complex to me. I have never worked with SAP Cloud Integration, but with a number of other integration tools, where I did a lot more (real life integration of complex business processes) than what is shown in this blog and it was much simpler. But I guess SAP customers are used to this and don’t question it. In 2022, software should be better than this!</p>

<p>What does the dialog titles <strong>“Hit List 17 Entries”</strong> and <strong>“Table Row 40 Entries”</strong> tell me? Nothing! 
This is from transaction VA02 (edit sales order) for Inco Terms (left) and Payment Terms (right). I wonder why something like this shipped in the first place and why it was not considered a bug in every single release that went out the door since then.</p>

<p>There are three films and three tv shows with the name “The Hit List”, but I doubt SAP is referring to any of them …</p>
