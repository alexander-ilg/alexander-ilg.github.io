I guess these stories are now also internationally very popular, but let me introduce you to a book that my mother and grandmother used to read to me when I was three years old: Struwwelpeter (Peter with the messy hair) It contains stories that should teach children to listen to their parents.

After 5 days, he starved to death. I wish I could loose weight so fast. Finally, this poor girl was playing with a lighter and guess what - she burned to death. Now you know why we started two world wars and invented software like SAP …" />
